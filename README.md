# Introduction
This is my repository that contains my implementation of Autogen using DuckDB to query the NY Yellow Taxi January 2024 parquet data. Please use the file autogen_sql_planning_test.ipynb to test out autogen with duckdb. Also make sure to make a config.py file to store your OpenAI secret.
